### Implementation Status:
âœ… Payment UI/UX - Complete
âœ… Data Models - Complete  
âœ… Firebase Integration - Complete
âœ… Payment Method Management - Complete
âœ… Transaction Recording - Complete

### Next Steps for Production:

1. **Get SafePay Credentials**:

   ```

3. **Test Payment Flow**:
   ```kotlin
   // The SafePayGateway is ready to use
   val gateway = SafePayGateway.getInstance()
   val result = gateway.createCheckout(amount, customer, orderId)
   ```

4. **Set up Webhook Endpoint** (for your backend):
   ```kotlin
   // Example webhook endpoint
   @POST("/webhook/safepay")
   fun handleSafePayWebhook(@Body webhookData: SafePayWebhookData) {
       SafePayWebhookHandler.getInstance().handleWebhook(webhookData)
   }
   ```

### Testing:
